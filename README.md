#### Volumes

- Application data is stored at `/data`.
- The shared volume at `/downloads` needs to be accessible from both Auto3T and Transmission.
- Mount your media archive volume(s) at `/media`.

### Redis

Redis serves as a cache and handles the queue. Redis only needs to be accessible from the Auto3T container. Redis does not store any persistent data.

### Prowlarr

When configuring your indexer, if the config is available, make sure to select Magnet option for both "Download link" and "Download link (fallback)".

### Jellyfin

This projects depends on various plugins to be installed and working correctly: 

* TVmaze
* TMDb
* TMDb Box Sets

Make sure the `/media` folder is shared with the `/media` folder of the Auto3T container.

### Transmission

The files generated by these containers can be accessed read and write from the user you are running the Auto3T container.

Make sure the `/downloads` folder is shared with the `/downloads` of the Auto3T container.

## Getting Started

Also see the docs for more details.

### Create user

Create your user by running:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

in the Auto3T docker container. Follow the prompts from there.

### Setup Auto3T

On the settings page:

- Configure your keywords you want to search for
- Configure your release target
- Configure your schedules

Then add your Shows, Movies, Collection and People you want to track. Sit back, and let Auto3T do its thing until your media appears in your Jellyfin like magic.
